# Kani-World
An NFT collection game on the Algorand bloockchain

# About
Kani World is an evolving NFT collection game where collectors compete for the chance to win new NFTs, and an opportunity to be a part of the evolution of the game. 

# How to Play
A player will require a Kani to take part in the game. The Kani comes in the form of an NFT. Anyone can play the game by purchasing a Kani NFT and holding it in their Algorand wallet. Players will be required to have some ALGO in their Algorand wallet to opt-in to the NFT assets. In addition, players will need to opt-in to any new Kani they win before claiming their prizes.

The current development plan consists of 3 stages. In the first stage, players will only be able to hold a Kani in their Algorand wallet. They can join the discord community, follow the KGE (Kani Generating Event), and hopefully win a new Kani. In the second stage, there will be the option to interact with a bot on Discord to accumulate "Kani coins". The players can then use the Kani coins to purchase one-off boosts to specific attributes and possibly give the Kani an advantage on the battlefield. The third stage is a website that connects to a wallet and allows players to choose which area they would like to battle. 

This plan is current at the time of writing and subject to change in the future.

# The Kani
The first 8 Kani have predefined colors and attributes. The predefined set is to create balance within the game. All Kani generated after the initial eight will be a combination of the characteristics of their parents and be decided by randomness during the KGE (Kani Generating Event). The main attributes of the Kani are their fighting skills (power, wrestling, stamina) and their procreation skills (stamina and charisma). The latter will be implemented into the game during the second stage. The Kani also have their shell color/schema and the possibility of a mutation. All color schemas and attributes are decided by random number generation at the creation of the Kani NFT. The stats of all Kani will be made public in the discord channel and on the website. The attributes will also remain publicly available on the blockchain in the form of attribute notes.

# Disclaimer
This project is currently a work in progress. Kani NFTs sold now are used to cover costs involved in creating the current NFTs. While the market will dictate what price is appropriate for the Kani, the NFTs in existence today do not guarantee a finished working game. I am currently working on this project solo and have somewhat limited resources and time, but a passion for this project.

As this project continues to evolve, new NFTs may change in some ways. There could be a need to modify existing attributes to provide a more balanced experience for the platers. Furthermore, there may be some features added to the game that could change the game's dynamics. I will try to consider the community before making any significant changes. Constructive feedback is welcome, as is any help the community wishes to provide.
